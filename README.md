# Image-Generation-using-stable-diffusion-Comfy-UI
This project demonstrates the implementation of Stable Diffusion, a deep-learning model used for text-to-image generation. It utilizes the Stable Diffusion v1.4 model from Hugging Face's diffusers library and integrates with ComfyUI for an interactive user experience. The project enables users to generate high-quality images based on textual prompts while optimizing performance and usability.

Features

Text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion

GPU acceleration support for faster processing

Image saving functionality for generated outputs

User-friendly interface with ComfyUI

Customizable parameters for better control over image generation

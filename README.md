# Image-Generation-using-stable-diffusion-Comfy-UI
This project demonstrates the implementation of Stable Diffusion, a deep-learning model used for text-to-image generation. It utilizes the Stable Diffusion v1.4 model from Hugging Face's diffusers library and integrates with ComfyUI for an interactive user experience. The project enables users to generate high-quality images based on textual prompts while optimizing performance and usability.

Features:
1.Text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion
2.GPU acceleration support for faster processing
3.Image saving functionality for generated outputs
4.User-friendly interface with ComfyUI
5.Customizable parameters for better control over image generation

Prerequisites:
1.Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
2.Python 3.8+ (Download Here)
3.PyTorch with CUDA support (for GPU acceleration)
4.Required Python libraries (listed below)
